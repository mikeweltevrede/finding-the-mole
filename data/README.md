Even though I am not a fan of the format usually, data is formatted as an Excel file where each column besides "Name"
represents a task. The value represents the following:
- P (Participant): the participant was not in the group where I would expect the Mole to be in.
- M (Mole): the participant was in the group where I would expect the Mole to be in.
- O (Omit): The task did not have an unequal division (e.g. on solo or duo tasks) or does not count for the analysis
  for some other reason.
- X: The person has been eliminated.

I chose for Excel because the data is not updated frequently and since it requires manual updating, this is easier to do
in Excel than in e.g. JSON or CSV.

For 2022, I copied the data from [CodeErik](https://www.codeerik.nl/widm-2023-op-zoek-naar-de-mol-met-data-analyse/).

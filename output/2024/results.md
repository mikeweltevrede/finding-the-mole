# Who Is The Mole 2024
It is finally time, the 2024 season of Who Is The Mole (WIDM) has started! In this document, I will outline the results
of my analyses and why I made certain choices.

Note that this document will contain spoilers about the episodes' tasks and who was eliminated.

## Episode 1
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna: 28.57% (2 points)
2. Fons, Jip, Justin: 14.29% (1 point)
3. Babs, Jeroen, Rian, Rosario: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
I argue that the Mole had a free choice of whether they would get a "vrijstelling" (exemption); in that sense, I would
say that the Mole group consisted of **Anna, Fons, Jip, and Justin**, which are the people that did not get the
exemption. I would suspect that the Mole would not want to get an exemption because this would only cause them to
potentially contribute 1,000 euros if someone would vote for them and have no benefits.

### Task 2
I omit this task. Although the Mole would want to vote for someone who did not have a exemption, I think this is
not information that is shared with the Mole. Moreover, not all votes have been shared in the episode.

### Task 3
Groups:
- Painters (Fons, Jeroen, Jip, Justin, Rosario): Copy a self-portrait of Frida Kahlo with as much detail as possible.
- Finders (Anna, Kees, Tooske): Unlock padlocks holding several options for paintings.
- Appraisers (Babs, Rian): Match the paintings from Group 1 and the Painters.

I argue that the Mole would not want to be a Painters; they would only have control over their own painting by e.g.
adding a detail that is clearly wrong or omitting a detail. Additionally, this would be too obvious to the group as well
as on camera.
- Personal consideration: Seeing as the 5 people who were in the "painters" group immediately raised their hand when
  groups were selected and the Mole has knowledge in advance, I presume that none of these people are the Mole. However,
  the model(s) will not take this assumption into account.

Either of the other groups could potentially hold the Mole. There are several considerations why I would think the Mole
would want to be a Finder:
- The Appraisers were relatively quick to not purchase additional paintings. The Mole would know that it might still be
  difficult.
  - If that is not the case, though, the choice was only offered to them after Babs and Rian decided who would look at
    the self-portraits and who would look at the "real" options. The Mole would then be able to make an assessment on
    whether it would be advantageous to buy or not. I think this might be a little too farfetched to take into account.
- In the episode, it seemed like the Finders divided the three boxes amongst themselves. This means that the Mole would
  have complete control over their box. They would know which of the padlocks would unlock a "real" painting.
- One of the Finders, Kees, seemed to be the only person to look at the painting that showed the padlock combinations.
  He could have easily said wrong numbers or one of the other participants could have entered a wrong number and say
  that they tried it.

## Episode 2
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna: 26.67% (4 points)
2. Fons: 20.00% (3 points)
3. Jip, Justin, Kees: 13.33% (2 points)
4. Rosario, Tooske: 6.67% (1 point)
5. Jeroen, Rian: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
Groups:
- Running and announcing: Anna, Fons, Kees
- Only running: Jeroen, Rosario, Tooske
- Placing signs: Jip, Justin, Rian

In this task, the participants visited the Olympic stadium. They were divided in two groups: people who would run around
the track to earn envelopes with instructions, and people who would place signs in a certain position based on these
instructions. Three of the six runners were selected to read the instructions through a microphone to the people placing
the signs.

I argue that the Mole has no intention in only running to collect the instructions. If they were to announce the
contents of the envelope though, that would be a powerful position. They could read the wrong instructions, mix up the
different pieces of paper, or place them on the wet grass to make them less legible. The Mole could also be in the group
placing signs since they have the ultimate control over what is earned. However, I feel like you can more easily check
on one another here and that is a danger. As such, I think the mole would be an announcer.

### Task 2
Groups:
- Daredevils: Anna, Fons, Jip, Justin, Rosario
- Relaxers: Jeroen, Kees, Rian, Tooske

In this task, the participants were divided into two groups: the Daredevils and the Relaxers. The Daredevils would be
climbing a mountain while listening to a podcast with interesting facts about Mexico. At the end of the climb, they
would have to answer a set of questions about that podcast, earning money for each correct answer. The Relaxers were
only instructed to "sit down and make themselves comfortable". That meant that if they would get up from their seats,
the podcast would be interrupted and the Daredevils could potentially miss crucial information.

I argue that the Mole would be in the Daredevils group. Although the Relaxers also have a powerful position, they would
not know what part of the podcast they would be interrupting so as a Mole you would have little control. The Daredevils
would have more control as they are actually answering the questions; even if they did not hear the question in the
podcast, they could still venture a guess or would happen to know the answer themselves. The Mole could, in this group,
have more control over whether money would be earned, simply by answering questions wrong.

### Task 3
There were only two tasks in this episode. I encoded the data with "O" for the 3rd task due to the assumption being made
in the current implementation that there is an equal number of tasks in each episode.

## Episode 3
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna: 23.53% (4 points)
2. Fons, Kees: 17.65% (3 points)
3. Justin, Rosario, Tooske: 11.76% (2 points)
4. Rian: 5.88% (1 point)
5. Jeroen: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
The participants were in a cantina where they would be playing in a pubquiz. They would pay a pre-determined amount of
money to be able to answer two questions about a song played by a mariachi band. For every question answered correctly,
they would get the amount paid, therefore losing money if they answered neither correctly, winning money if they
answered both correctly, and have no profit otherwise.

Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 2
The participants had to walk the streets to find tables with statements about themselves. The two people that these
statements applied to, had to join at the table and then choose from two cities which lies the farthest from Amsterdam.
The answer to that question, would have to be entered into a puzzle at the end.

Once again, although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of
groups in some sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
Groups:
- Arena: Kees, Rian, Rosario, Tooske
- Streets: Anna, Jeroen
- Hotel room: Fons, Justin

This task related to wrestling, The participants were spread over three locations with specific tasks attached:
1. Arena: the participants in the arena, had to take selfies with each of the wrestlers. They could only take one selfie
   per wrestler and the selfie could not contain other wrestlers.
2. Streets: the participants out in the streets had to get descriptions of wrestlers from locals and then had to draw
   pictures of them.
3. Hotel room: the participants in the hotel room would receive the selfies and drawings from the other two groups and
   had to link them together so that you would have a drawing of a wrestler with four selfies with that wrestler.

Although the people in the hotel room make the final decision about how to link the drawings and selfies, I would argue
that the arena is the most powerful position for the Mole to be in. They can easily invalidate an entire option to earn
money by sending in multiple selfies per wrestler, making vague photos, or having multiple wrestlers on the same photo.

## Episode 4
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna, Fons, Kees: 21.05% (4 points)
2. Rosario, Tooske: 15.79% (3 points)
3. Rian: 5.26% (1 point)
4. Jeroen: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
Groups:
- Cyclists: Fons, Kees, Rosario, Tooske
- Shoppers: Anna, Jeroen, Rian

The participants were divided into Cyclists and Shoppers. The host of the show bought several artifacts at the antique
market for 250 euros. The Shoppers had to purchase artifacts so that the Cyclists would, at the end, value their set of
items higher than the one the host bought. The Shoppers initially had 100 euros but could receive more money due to
actions from the Cyclists. These would be offered phone calls where they could earn money for the Shoppers. They could
also earn jokers* for some phone calls. All in all, the longer they called, the less money they would win per correctly
chosen artifact at the end of the task.

I think the Mole would want to be a Cyclist. Not only would they be able to call for a long time to reduce the amount of
money earned per item by either calling longer or going for jokers instead of money, but they also made the final choice
of which item was bought by the Shoppers. The Shoppers had control in the task by buying stuff that looked cheap but
they generally stuck together. Moreover, they did not have much control in the final choices.

\* A joker is an item which would render a wrong answer at the elimination test as correct.

### Task 2
The participants were divided into two groups. Within each group, they had to solve puzzles and play games. Upon a
successful solve, they would earn money. If the solution was wrong, they would lose money.

Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
There were only two tasks in this episode. I encoded the data with "O" for the 3rd task due to the assumption being made
in the current implementation that there is an equal number of tasks in each episode.

## Episode 5
Important: in this episode, one of the currently three eliminated participants could return to the game. This turned out
to be Babs. However, I think there is no way she can be the Mole. There was no way that she would have been able to
force her return due to the method in which this was set up. Moreover, I see no reason why the Mole would want to be
eliminated and miss out on being able to sabotage tasks. As such, I will not take Babs into account in further analyses.

The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Fons: 23.81% (5 points)
2. Anna, Kees: 19.05% (4 points)
3. Rosario, Tooske: 14.29% (3 points)
4. Jeroen, Rian: 4.76% (1 point)

### Task 1
Groups:
- Flags: Fons, Jeroen
- Carts: Anna, Babs, Kees, Rian, Rosario, Tooske

The participants were asked to make duos, after which one of these had to volunteer to take on an "important role".
This was the duo of Fons and Jeroen. The other duos were being driven around and had to look out for signposts where on
one side it would show some amount of Euros and on the other side a colour. Fons and Jeroen received a hint for the final
solution (a series of numbers) and then were sent off to a location where there were many coloured flags. It turned out
they had to count the flags per colour and select the colours of which the counts matched the numbers in the series they
were given. Adding up all amounts found by the other duos for those colours would lead to the amount of money they could
win in this task.

It is not immediately clear where the Mole would want to be. The Mole could want to count the flags so that a single
miscount could lead to a wrong colour being selected, already invalidating the result before the addition of the amounts
had started. There would only be one person checking you and with the limit time and the hectic nature of the task, it
might not be dangerous to sabotage here. If the Mole would be in one of the carts, there would also be only one other
person checking them. They could try to name a wrong colour or amount, or just fail to announce that a signpost would be
coming up, hoping that the other person would miss it or only see the back, at which point it would already be too late.
However, judging from the episode, that would be much easier to check.

Based on this, I would say the Mole might have a slight preference for the Flags duo.
- NB: At the end of the episode, Jeroen was eliminated. This means that this only gives a point to Fons. However, note
    that the input data should not take something like this into account. It should reflect a view only on where the
    Mole would want to be for each task. Moreover, in the other case it would also not add much information since it
    only would NOT give a point to Fons. In either case, the added value of this task to the model is probably not much
    but not little enough to justify omitting this task.

### Task 2
The participants had to strike down piñatas which had words with blanks on them where the word "mol" would fit. They
would receive a call with a description of one of these words and then had to find the corresponding piñata and open it
to receive a hint as to where they had to go.

Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
The participants had to choose one of several envelopes. At the start, these all contained money. However, at the start,
they were given a choice of whether they wanted to add one or more jokers or topito* to the envelopes. If they chose to
do so (which everyone did in one form or the other), they also had to pick a certain number of envelopes which would
contain "negative" money, i.e. when picked, that money would be deducted from the pot.

Of course, the Mole would want to get many envelopes with negative money added. However, I do not think that it is
directly obvious that they would always choose for the topito or three jokers. Otherwise, I would have defined the Mole
group as those people selecting those. Moreover, there was no unequal division of groups in some sort of way. As such, I
omit this task from the analysis.

\* If you won a topito in this task, it meant that you had to find three others who also won a topito so that all of you
would get an exemption.

## Episode 6
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Fons: 25.00% (5 points)
2. Anna, Kees: 20.00% (4 points)
3. Rosario, Tooske: 15.00% (3 points)
4. Rian: 5.00% (1 point)

### Task 1
The participants were instructed on the Mayan way of counting. Then, they had to collect stones with Mayan numbers on
them that added up to a specific number which was depicted on a table.

Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 2
The participants watched several traditional dances from Mexico. During the one from Yucatán, they were given
instructions on which people they had to remove from the group (e.g. all women with a black or white fan). These
instructions were given to one person, after which the participants had to whisper them to one another like the
Telephone Game. At the end, five dancers would be left and the participants would earn money per correct dancer.

Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
The participants did this task en route to making their test. They were told that in the test, they would only be shown
the answers to the questions. While walking to the laptop, they would encounter the questions, which they had to
remember.

There was no opportunity to earn money in this task. Moreover, there was no unequal division of groups in some sort of
way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

## Episode 7
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna, Fons: 26.09% (6 points)
2. Kees: 21.74% (5 points)
3. Rian, Rosario: 13.04% (3 points)

### Task 1
The participants had to do several small tasks related to music, e.g. linking musical terms to their meaning and
Pictionary with song titles. For each correctly executed task, money would be earned.

At first, I was not sure if there was some sort of way in which I could determine a Mole group, e.g. the tasks that did
not earn money. However, there was no structure there and for some tasks they swapped the groups throughout. As such,
although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 2
Waiters: Kees, Rosario
Drivers: Anna, Babs, Fons, Rian

The participants had to pick up several people who had booked a table at a brunch. At the end, they had to put these
people in a line, ordering them alphabetically by their first name. They would gain money per person as long as the line
was still in alphabetical order. So, that means that even though there is a mistake, the line could still be in order.
For instance, consider the line of people with names Angela, Betty, Charlie, Carl, etcetera. Even though Carl should
have been placed before Charlie, the first three people are still in alphabetical order. In this case, the participants
would receive the amount of money for three correct answers.

The participants were divided into two groups: four people would drive around the town to pick up the guests and bring
them to the restaurant (Drivers). The other two people would be at the restaurant as Waiters from the get-go, receiving
the guests when they were dropped off. The drivers would join the latter two as Waiters when time was up.

I do not really see any benefit for the Mole to want to be a Waiter from the get-go. If they were a driver, they could
execute several strategies. For example, they could pick up many people which would increase the probability of messing
up the alphabetical order (either due to the large number of people by itself or because they could claim someone's name
is Carlos while it was Charlie). They could also choose to skip picking up guests; the Mole might know where the guests
are waiting, or they would just spot the guests and drive past them. Another option would be to stall and just drive
around leisurely. As such, I assume the Mole would want to be a Driver.

### Task 3
Looked: Fons, Rosario
Did not look: Anna, Babs, Kees, Rian

The participants were called into a private room one-by-one. They were offered the opportunity to take a look at ten
questions that would be on the test in the finals. This would cost them 500 euros. If no one looked, they would earn
3,000 euros. If they themselves did not look, they were told that "integrity would be rewarded". After everyone made
their choice, those that did not look were informed that they could bid on an exemption for that episode's elimination.
They would have to mention a bid as well as a person whom they suspected did look. If that was correct, the amount bid
would be deducted from the group pot.

Especially since it would not be revealed who looked, except for the person indicated by the highest bidder, there was
little reason for the Mole to look. They gain nothing from the information and the only reason would be to guarantee the
3,000 euros would not be earned. However, it is generally safe to assume that at least one person would look, so you can
take the risk. If you do not look, and you bid at least 500 euros, you already have a high chance that you remove more
money from the pot that if you did look; either you will remove this amount or someone who bid higher. If it turns out
that the person that was suspected from having looked actually did not look, this was only a small gamble to make for
the Mole. As such, I suspect the Mole to not have looked.

## Episode 8
Opdr 1: lasergame + vertrouwen
- Joker: Fons
- Geld: Kees, Anna, Rian
- Sor apart

Opdr 2: zinnen maken
- Zinne maken: Fons
- Woorden verzamelen: Rian+Sor, Kees+Anna

### Task 1
The participants were asked to rank their fellow participants based on how much they trust them. The person who was
collectively trusted the most was given a special role (more on that later); this was Rosario. The other four had to
move between locations where they had to build a house of cards. If they completed one layer, they would earn money
(different amounts per location). If they completed two or three layers, they would get one or two jokers, respectively.
When they collected their reward, they would go to the final location, where Rosario would be waiting for them. They had
to convince Rosario that they had won money. He could choose whether to eliminate them or not. If he eliminated the
participant, and they had money, that money would be lost. However, if they had jokers, Rosario would steal them.

The Mole could, of course, not choose if they would receive the special role that Rosario received. Even though it is
highly unlikely that the Mole is the most trusted participant, it is still an option. As such, I will determine that
role to be a Mole role because the Mole would have no control. For the other group, I suspect the Mole had enough time
before the recordings to practise making a house of cards. As such, I assume that the Mole would want to get jokers to
avoid creating the opportunity that money would be earned. Only Fons went for the joker; the rest tried to go for jokers
but failed (claiming it was too difficult or there was time pressure).

In conclusion: I assign Fons and Rosario to the Mole group for this task.

### Task 2
Because Fons was trusted the least in the last task, he was given the special role in this task. The other participants
had to magnet fish words that Fons would have to use in a sentence (some restrictions applied). Although there are
definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some sort of way in a
way that they could have control over. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
There were only two tasks in this episode. I encoded the data with "O" for the 3rd task due to the assumption being made
in the current implementation that there is an equal number of tasks in each episode.

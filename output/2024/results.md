# Who Is The Mole 2024
It is finally time, the 2024 season of Who Is The Mole (WIDM) has started! In this document, I will outline the results
of my analyses and why I made certain choices.

Note that this document will contain spoilers about the episodes' tasks and who was eliminated.

## Episode 1
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Anna: 28.57% (2 points)
2. Fons, Jip, Justin: 14.29% (1 point)
3. Babs, Jeroen, Rian, Rosario: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
I argue that the Mole had a free choice of whether they would get a "vrijstelling" (exemption); in that sense, I would
say that the Mole group consisted of **Anna, Fons, Jip, and Justin**, which are the people that did not get the
exemption. I would suspect that the Mole would not want to get an exemption because this would only cause them to
potentially contribute 1,000 euros if someone would vote for them and have no benefits.

### Task 2
I omit this task. Although the Mole would want to vote for someone who did not have a exemption, I think this is
not information that is shared with the Mole. Moreover, not all votes have been shared in the episode.

### Task 3
Groups:
- Painters (Fons, Jeroen, Jip, Justin, Rosario): Copy a self-portrait of Frida Kahlo with as much detail as possible.
- Finders (Anna, Kees, Tooske): Unlock padlocks holding several options for paintings.
- Appraisers (Babs, Rian): Match the paintings from Group 1 and the Painters.

I argue that the Mole would not want to be a Painters; they would only have control over their own painting by e.g.
adding a detail that is clearly wrong or omitting a detail. Additionally, this would be too obvious to the group as well
as on camera.
- Personal consideration: Seeing as the 5 people who were in the "painters" group immediately raised their hand when
  groups were selected and the Mole has knowledge in advance, I presume that none of these people are the Mole. However,
  the model(s) will not take this assumption into account.

Either of the other groups could potentially hold the Mole. There are several considerations why I would think the Mole
would want to be a Finder:
- The Appraisers were relatively quick to not purchase additional paintings. The Mole would know that it might still be
  difficult.
  - If that is not the case, though, the choice was only offered to them after Babs and Rian decided who would look at
    the self-portraits and who would look at the "real" options. The Mole would then be able to make an assessment on
    whether it would be advantageous to buy or not. I think this might be a little too farfetched to take into account.
- In the episode, it seemed like the Finders divided the three boxes amongst themselves. This means that the Mole would
  have complete control over their box. They would know which of the padlocks would unlock a "real" painting.
- One of the Finders, Kees, seemed to be the only person to look at the painting that showed the padlock combinations.
  He could have easily said wrong numbers or one of the other participants could have entered a wrong number and say
  that they tried it.

## Episode 2

### Task 1
Groups:
- Running and announcing: Anna, Fons, Kees
- Only running: Jeroen, Rosario, Tooske
- Placing signs: Jip, Justin, Rian

In this task, the participants visited the Olympic stadium. They were divided in two groups: people who would run around
the track to earn envelopes with instructions, and people who would place signs in a certain position based on these
instructions. Three of the six runners were selected to read the instructions through a microphone to the people placing
the signs.

I argue that the Mole has no intention in only running to collect the instructions. If they were to announce the
contents of the envelope though, that would be a powerful position. They could read the wrong instructions, mix up the
different pieces of paper, or place them on the wet grass to make them less legible. The Mole could also be in the group
placing signs since they have the ultimate control over what is earned. However, I feel like you can more easily check
on one another here and that is a danger. As such, I think the mole would be an announcer.

### Task 2
Groups:
- Daredevils: Anna, Fons, Jip, Justin, Rosario
- Relaxers: Jeroen, Kees, Rian, Tooske

In this task, the participants were divided into two groups: the Daredevils and the Relaxers. The Daredevils would be
climbing a mountain while listening to a podcast with interesting facts about Mexico. At the end of the climb, they
would have to answer a set of questions about that podcast, earning money for each correct answer. The Relaxers were
only instructed to "sit down and make themselves comfortable". That meant that if they would get up from their seats,
the podcast would be interrupted and the Daredevils could potentially miss crucial information.

I argue that the Mole would be in the Daredevils group. Although the Relaxers also have a powerful position, they would
not know what part of the podcast they would be interrupting so as a Mole you would have little control. The Daredevils
would have more control as they are actually answering the questions; even if they did not hear the question in the
podcast, they could still venture a guess or would happen to know the answer themselves. The Mole could, in this group,
have more control over whether money would be earned, simply by answering questions wrong.

### Task 3
There were only two tasks in this episode. I encoded the data with "O" for the 3rd task due to the assumption being made
in the current implementation that there is an equal number of tasks in each episode.

# Who Is The Mole 2024 - Belgium
It is time for the 2024 season of Who Is The Mole (WIDM) Belgium! In this document, I will outline the results of my
analyses and why I made certain choices.

Note that this document will contain spoilers about the episodes' tasks and who was eliminated.

## Episode 1
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Bernard: 23.08% (3 points)
2. Charlotte, Stéphanie: 15.38% (2 points)
3. Coco, Karolien, Lynn, Michaël, Philippe, Senne: 7.69% (1 point)
4. Gillian: 0.00% (0 points)

### Task 1
#### Task description
In the first task of the first episode, the participants are divided into three groups on or around a ship:
1. Bernard, Charlotte, Senne, Stéphanie: These participants had to connect photos of certain objects to their fellow
    participants, e.g. a Harry Potter book for someone who likes to read Harry Potter.
2. Coco, Gillian, Karolien, Michaël: These participants had to introduce themselves for 58 - 62 seconds. If they failed,
    they had to start over.
3. Lynn, Philippe: These participants had to answer trivia where they had to name 5 answers for a certain category. For
    every correctly answered question, Philippe would be lowered to the ground one meter. If he reached the ground, he
    would be able to fetch Lynn.

PS: Lynn was placed on a boat outside the ship because she (allegedly) was the only person who said they did not want
to be the Mole.

If a group of participants completed their task, they had to press a red button to reveal a map with where to go to get
their notebooks<sup>*</sup>. However, if they pressed that button, the people who did not complete their task yet, would
be eliminated from the rest of the task. If they got the notebook and brought it to the table where the host sat, on
time, they would earn 1,000 Euros per notebook.

In the end, group 1 completed their task first and waited a while for the others to complete their task. In the end,
however, they pressed the button because it took too long. Everyone was able to retrieve a notebook but there was also
something else to collect that was new to this season. They were indicated on the map as question marks (more on their
meaning later). Bernard collected two of these and Senne took the remaining one. The group reached the table in time,
thereby earning 4,000 Euros for the pot.

<sup>*</sup> Candidates of WIDM take notes during the season in a notebook given to them. In Dutch, this is called the
"Molboekje" ("Mole book").

#### My conclusion
I assume that the Mole was able to choose where they wanted to be. It could even be Lynn, for that matter. If I were the
Mole, I would either want to stall my task, thereby taking an almost guaranteed 2,000 or 4,000 Euros away from the
amount to be won, or (more likely) I would want to complete my task and eliminate the others. I think the second option
is more likely and the group you would want to be in is the group where you would have control over the completion.
I think this is only possible in **group 1**, where you could suggest correct answers if you think others might be
completing their tasks soon. Once you are on deck and have access to the button, you can suggest to press it to
eliminate others.

### Task 2
#### Task description
The participants were divided into two groups:
1. Olive pickers: Gillian, Karolien, Senne, Stéphanie
2. Dancers: Bernard, Charlotte, Coco, Lynn, Michaël, Philippe

The olive pickers had to, obviously, pick olives. They would have to put these in one of 6 bins. Each bin represented
an answer to a question about their fellow participants - e.g. what is Michaël afraid of? The more olives were put in
the correct bins, the more money they would earn (1,000 Euros per kilo).

In the other group, the dancers had to do a regional dance where they were connected with lints to a pole, together with
local dancers. The local dancers would be wearing tags with words on them. If a colour would be repeated amongst those
tags, the participants had to knock over a peg in that colour to eliminate that bin (it would also be knocked over at
the olive tree farm).

#### My conclusion
I would think that the Mole wanted to be a **dancer**. It was seemingly difficult to knock over the pegs consistently
since you had to do it mid-dance. It happened 2 out of 3 times that multiple pegs were knocked over at the same time
when they only meant to knock over one. Moreover, many of the words on the tags looked like colours, so you could easily
claim you saw two occurrences of a certain colour; the other person could not check it. However, at the olive tree farm,
you could try to convince others to put the olives in the wrong bins and put olives in the wrong bin yourself, but it
seemed like it was easy to check each other.

### Task 3
#### Task description
It was revealed that the "question marks" picked up in Task 1 were actually "doublers". These could be played before a
task to double the amount of money that could be won in that task. However, one person had to be selected as the keeper
of those doublers. That person would select when to play the doublers, but if that person would be eliminated from the
game, the doublers would also be lost. In return for this "risk", the keeper would be offered an exemption from this
week's elimination.

The participants watched recordings of their own responses when they heard they were selected to be on the Mole. They
could press a button to stop the recording. The three participants who pressed most quickly, were candidates to become
the keeper. These turned out to be Bernard, Karolien, and Stéphanie.

In the next stage, all participants came together. They were told that they had multiple rounds to vote in order to
find and eliminate the candidates. Last candidate standing would become the keeper. For each time they voted for a
non-candidate though (the group did not know who they were), the amount of money to be won in this task was halved. They
started with 4,000 Euros. In the end, the group ended up with 2,000 Euros and Bernard became the keeper and earned the
exemption for episode 1.

#### My conclusion
It makes sense for the Mole to want to be the keeper. They have prior knowledge of the tasks and know which ones are
difficult. They could play the doublers on these tasks. The Mole could also not play the doublers at all or even lose
(some of) them.

## Episode 2
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Bernard: 22.22% (4 points)
2. Senne: 16.67% (3 points)
3. Charlotte, Lynn, Philippe, Stéphanie: 11.11% (2 points)
4. Coco, Karolien, Michaël: 5.56% (1 point)

### Task 1
#### Task description
The participants were divided into two groups:
1. Ice cream collectors: Charlotte, Karolien, Michaël, Coco, Stéphanie
2. Car collectors: Bernard, Lynn, Philippe, Senne

The goal of the task was to deliver ice cream cones to the host of the show, who was at a beach somewhere far from the
task location; as such, they needed to go by car. The ice creams had to be of a certain height when they arrived and
they only had a limited amount of time.

The ice cream collectors had to do minigames to earn scoops of ice cream. The car collectors had to retrieve the cars by
completing a sliding puzzle with actual cars. They collected the keys to the cars by guessing if certain car brands were
Italian or not. For every wrong guess, some play time would be deducted. Once the cars were freed, they then had to pick
up the former and drive to the final location.

#### My conclusion
There is no question that the Mole wanted to collect the cars. You get complete control over the play time, which you
can sabotage by answering wrong on the car brands (which is easy due to the hectic nature of the game) but also by
obstructing the sliding puzzle (stalling or just putting cars in wrong locations). Moreover, you would also have a good
chance of driving the car. This allows you to drive more recklessly, causing ice creams to spill, or to drive a bit more
slowly when possible.

### Task 2
#### Task description
The participants were divided into duos, determined by which seat they took at the breakfast table. There was a special
role for Senne, who arrived at the table last.

It turns out Senne was locked in on the top floor of an old castle. The other participants entered the castle and had to
complete tasks to try to reach and free him within a certain time. The catch was that they had to keep the candle on
their helmet burning; this could be extinguished by dropping water (first room) or fans (second room) throughout the
castle. In the second room, Senne could help by temporarily disabling the fans (the participants could communicate with
Senne through a walkie-talkie). Once the participants reached Senne, which turned out to be Philippe and Karolien, they
saw a board telling them that certain people had a chance of gaining a personal advantage. They could reorder these
using a provided hammer in Senne's cell, i.e. he had to give it to Karolien and Philippe.

#### My conclusion
The Mole could kind of choose where they wanted to be: locked up on the top floor or in the other group; all they had to
do is get up early or late. I can see an argument for both sides with perhaps a slight preference for Senne's role
because you have control over the fans in the second room (and an advantage for the third task, as I will explain in a
bit). On the other hand, in the other group you can stall the time and actively obstruct the progress in the second room
by discouraging talking to Senne.

In the third task, it is optimal for the Mole to be placed as high on the board as possible (see the task's
explanation). Being in the locked room, you do not have control over where you go, but you can kind of guarantee that
you go at most second. The participants that free you will put themselves at the top position, of course, and it will be
easy to make them sympathize with you and put you next. You can even bargain with them for this and stall time by not
giving the hammer.

As such, I would give a very slight preference for the Mole to want to be in Senne's position.

### Task 3
#### Task description
Order (as decided in task 2):
1. Karolien, Philippe
2. Michaël, Senne
3. Charlotte, Stéphanie
4. Bernard, Coco
5. Lynn

In the middle of the night, the participants would be awoken in the provided order. They were given the option to open
"Pandora's Box", which would contain 8 jokers. They were cryptically instructed beforehand that opening the box would
have grave consequences. If they would not open the box at all, they would earn money. It turned out that these
consequences were that the group pot would quickly start decreasing until all 9 participants were present at the box
and placed their hands on the correct location on a screen. In the end, the box was opened by Michaël and Senne.

#### My conclusion
You can see why the Mole would want to guarantee that the box would be opened, although it is also fair to assume that
the box would be opened anyway. However, since the order was decided in the task before by Karolien, Philippe, and
Senne, and I also took this into account in determining the Mole group in task 2, I do not take this task into account.

# Episode 3
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Bernard: 26.92% (7 points)
2. Charlotte: 15.38% (4 points)
3. Michaël, Philippe, Senne: 11.54% (3 points)
4. Coco, Lynn, Stéphanie: 7.69% (2 points)

### Task 1
#### Task description
The participants were divided into three groups:
1. Interception: Bernard, Coco
2. Money drop locations: Charlotte, Senne
3. Mafia member traits: Lynn, Michaël, Philippe, Stéphanie

The goal of the task was to intercept money drops by the Sicilian mafia. Group 2 would receive phone calls which they
had to answer them when the ringtone was an Italian song, upon which they would hear the location where the money would
be dropped. They would communicate this to Group 1, who would try to find the bag of money. In the meantime, Group 3
would have to complete some subtasks to get hints about the traits of the mafia member. The group would earn the money
that they intercepted if and only if they could point to the correct mafia member at the end.

#### My conclusion
I think that the Mole would prefer to be in Group 1. It was a difficult village to navigate, and they could easily stall
or sow confusion. In Group 2, you could communicate the wrong location but the other person can easily check you. In
Group 3, you also have some control over the success of the task, although it turned out to be quite easy to get the
hints for the mafia member.

### Task 2
#### Task description
Four participants were chosen by the Mole to have to remain silent during the next task: Bernard, Charlotte, Coco, and
Michaël. If they succeeded, they would earn money for each person that did not speak. Besides this exercise, the group
had to complete three subtasks, for each of these you would earn money.

#### My conclusion
The Mole could, of course, which group they wanted to be in. If they submitted themselves to not speak, they could
guarantee control over the amount of money that they would be able to earn. They could also be leading in the possible
success of the subtasks because they had to communicate their goal with the rest. If they would not be silenced, they
could only participate in the tasks and try to make them fail. This proved a bit tricky, so I think the Mole would want
to silence themselves.

### Task 3
#### Task description
The participants were divided into two groups:
1. Piaggio drivers: Bernard, Charlotte, Michaël, Philippe
2. The others: Coco, Lynn, Senne, Stéphanie

Group 1 held a duel where they took turns to name a kind of pasta. The first one to fail to name a correct type, would
lose. The cost of losing would be that they would each gain a "negative joker", meaning that a correct answer on the
elimination test would be counted as incorrect. Group 2 then had to interview the Piaggio drivers and determine who
lost. If they succeeded, they would earn money for the group pot. If they failed to do so, everyone except for the
losers of the duel would gain the "negative joker" and no money would be earned.

#### My conclusion
The Mole would probably want to be driving a Piaggio. This would give them control over the task, and they could adapt
their strategy in the interview based on whether they won the duel (they would want the group to point to the winners,
of course).

# Episode 4
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Bernard: 30.00% (9 points)
2. Charlotte: 20.00% (6 points)
3. Senne: 13.33% (4 points)
4. Coco, Michaël, Stéphanie: 10.00% (3 points)
5. Lynn: 6.67% (2 points)

### Task 1
#### Task description
Groups:
1. Plumbers: Lynn, Michaël, Stéphanie
2. Racers: Bernard, Charlotte, Coco, Senne

The participants jumped into the world of Super Mario! The racers would compete against the fastest kart racer of Italy.
To help them, the plumbers traversed a side-scrolling AR video game like Mario to collect bananas (which would slow
their opponent down when thrown into a basket at the end of a round) and speed-power ups (which would speed up one
racer, decided by the plumbers). The task would be successful for each racer that could stay ahead of their opponent
for 15 rounds.

#### My conclusion
The Mole would definitely want to be a racer. They have control over their own finishing time (if at all), as well as
whether they would hit or miss the banana throws in the basket. It also turned out that Senne stopped when he still
had one more round to go - the plumbers had the task to keep track of how many rounds they already went. That also
provides a reason for the Mole to want to be a plumber, but I think they would have less control over the task.

### Task 2
#### Task description
Groups:
1. Dough: Lynn, Senne
2. Toppings: Coco, Michaël
3. Delivery: Bernard, Charlotte, Stéphanie

The next task was pizza-themed. The participants in group 1 had to learn how to create pizza dough and then had to throw
it from one building to another. Group 2 had to taste several pizzas blindfolded and then had to identify the one
ingredient shared between the two pizzas. The last group had to carry large stacks of pizza boxes down a tough hiking
trail, taking care not to drop them on the floor. Based on the results, each individual group could send a number of
people to the final part of the task. In that final task, they had to carry a pizza to the other side of the town while
dodging the pineapple that people were trying to throw onto their pizza. The finals were played by Lynn, Michaël, Senne,
and Stéphanie, of which only Michaël's pizza survived.

#### My conclusion
Of course, the Mole would prefer to make the final game themselves but there is no way to guarantee that they would
convince their subtask partner(s) that they should go (if not all of them could go to the final game). As such, I think
we have to determine the Mole group as one of the subtask groups, namely the one where it would likely be easiest to
send as few people as possible to the final game. I believe that this is the delivery group. The bar was set pretty
high and, as Mole, you can easily drop a few boxes. In the toppings group, identifying wrong ingredients can be quite
difficult as tastes are usually pretty pronounced so you need a good alternative. I think the only group that the Mole
would not want to be in, is the dough group. Because I want to pick just one group, I choose the delivery group.

### Task 3
#### Task description
The participants were told (by the Mole) that the person who would be eliminated that episode could strike a deal with
them. The Mole would correct at most 4 wrong answers on their test. Of course, the more answers corrected, the more
money this would cost. Before the elimination, the participants were called to see if they would be eliminated at that
point. The participants then had to try to identify the person who would be eliminated, thereby invalidating their deal
with the Mole.

#### My conclusion
The Mole can only sabotage this task by trying to convince everyone to let them correct as many answers as possible.
Additionally, they might know who would be eliminated (they indicated in their talk with the participants that they
saw the test scores) so that their strategy would be to steer the group away from the eliminated person so that the
money from their corrected answers would be deducted from the group pot.

As such, I omit this task. There is no way to identify a Mole group for this task.

# Episode 5
The ranking of the Baseline Model is:
1. Bernard: 31.03% (9 points)
2. Charlotte: 20.69% (6 points)
3. Senne: 17.24% (5 points)
4. Michaël: 13.79% (4 points)
5. Stéphanie: 10.34% (3 points)
6. Lynn: 6.90% (2 points)

### Task 1
#### Task description
Groups:
1. Hercules: Michaël, Senne
2. Sisyphus: Bernard, Stéphanie
3. Danaides: Charlotte, Lynn

The participants had to traverse a course in the theme of Greek mythology. Group 1 had to travel to the end of the
course. Someone named Hercules was there, lifting two pillars. If these pillars would fall, the task would fail.
Group 1 had to take over lifting the pillars after 30 minutes, after which Hercules would also put extra weights on the
pillars every few minutes. In the meantime, group 1 had to push a heavy ball up a hill where they had to answer three
questions, the answers to which were printed onto the ball. Every time that they answered incorrectly, they had to carry
the ball all the way to the beginning of the course and start over. Group 2 had to fill a barrel with water, but the
barrel had holes in it that they had to close with wooden pegs.

#### My conclusion
The Hercules group had full control over the success of the task. No matter how much money they had gathered, if they
would drop the pillars before everyone reached the end of the course, no money would be won. As such, I think the
Mole would want to be in group 1.

### Task 2
#### Task description
The mothers of the participants were visiting. The participants first had to guess which spaghetti bolognese was made
by their own mom (or sister in the case of Stéphanie). If they would all guess correctly, they would earn money.

#### My conclusion
Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

### Task 3
#### Task description
The participants and their mothers had to build a tower out of blocks. After this, a small earthquake would be
simulated. The lowest tower would be eliminated.  This happened for three rounds. At the end of each round, a
multiple choice question about the participants would be asked. If the participants answered the same as their
mother/sister, they would earn money and some additional blocks for their tower. When three participants remained,
they played the final game. The participants were offered a choice between one joker or a luxurious weekend away
with their mother. If their mother/sister could correctly guess which choice they made, the participant would win
whatever they chose. If all choices were correctly identified, the money earned earlier would be added to the pot.

#### My conclusion
Although there are definitely actions the Mole could take in this task, there was no unequal division of groups in some
sort of way. As such, I omit this task from the analysis.

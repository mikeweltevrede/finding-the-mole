# Who Is The Mole 2024 - Belgium
It is time for the 2024 season of Who Is The Mole (WIDM) Belgium! In this document, I will outline the results of my
analyses and why I made certain choices.

Note that this document will contain spoilers about the episodes' tasks and who was eliminated.

## Episode 1
### Task 1
#### Task description
In the first task of the first episode, the participants are divided into three groups on or around a ship:
1. Bernard, Charlotte, Senne, Stéphanie: These participants had to connect photos of certain objects to their fellow
    participants, e.g. a Harry Potter book for someone who likes to read Harry Potter.
2. Coco, Gillian, Karolien, Michaël: These participants had to introduce themselves for 58 - 62 seconds. If they failed,
    they had to start over.
3. Lynn, Philippe: These participants had to answer trivia where they had to name 5 answers for a certain category. For
    every correctly answered question, Philippe would be lowered to the ground one meter. If he reached the ground, he
    would be able to fetch Lynn.

PS: Lynn was placed on a boat outside the ship because she (allegedly) was the only person who said they did not want
to be the Mole.

If a group of participants completed their task, they had to press a red button to reveal a map with where to go to get
their notebooks<sup>*</sup>. However, if they pressed that button, the people who did not complete their task yet, would
be eliminated from the rest of the task. If they got the notebook and brought it to the table where the host sat, on
time, they would earn 1,000 Euros per notebook.

In the end, group 1 completed their task first and waited a while for the others to complete their task. In the end,
however, they pressed the button because it took too long. Everyone was able to retrieve a notebook but there was also
something else to collect that was new to this season. They were indicated on the map as question marks (more on their
meaning later). Bernard collected two of these and Senne took the remaining one. The group reached the table in time,
thereby earning 4,000 Euros for the pot.

<sup>*</sup> Candidates of WIDM take notes during the season in a notebook given to them. In Dutch, this is called the
"Molboekje" ("Mole book").

#### My conclusion
I assume that the Mole was able to choose where they wanted to be. It could even be Lynn, for that matter. If I were the
Mole, I would either want to stall my task, thereby taking an almost guaranteed 2,000 or 4,000 Euros away from the
amount to be won, or (more likely) I would want to complete my task and eliminate the others. I think the second option
is more likely and the group you would want to be in is the group where you would have control over the completion.
I think this is only possible in **group 1**, where you could suggest correct answers if you think others might be
completing their tasks soon. Once you are on deck and have access to the button, you can suggest to press it to
eliminate others.

### Task 2
#### Task description
The participants were divided into two groups:
1. Olive pickers: Gillian, Karolien, Senne, Stéphanie
2. Dancers: Bernard, Charlotte, Coco, Lynn, Michaël, Philippe

The olive pickers had to, obviously, pick olives. They would have to put these in one of 6 bins. Each bin represented
an answer to a question about their fellow participants - e.g. what is Michaël afraid of? The more olives were put in
the correct bins, the more money they would earn (1,000 Euros per kilo).

In the other group, the dancers had to do a regional dance where they were connected with lints to a pole, together with
local dancers. The local dancers would be wearing tags with words on them. If a colour would be repeated amongst those
tags, the participants had to knock over a peg in that colour to eliminate that bin (it would also be knocked over at
the olive tree farm).

#### My conclusion
I would think that the Mole wanted to be a **dancer**. It was seemingly difficult to knock over the pegs consistently
since you had to do it mid-dance. It happened 2 out of 3 times that multiple pegs were knocked over at the same time
when they only meant to knock over one. Moreover, many of the words on the tags looked like colours, so you could easily
claim you saw two occurrences of a certain colour; the other person could not check it. However, at the olive tree farm,
you could try to convince others to put the olives in the wrong bins and put olives in the wrong bin yourself, but it
seemed like it was easy to check each other.

### Task 3
#### Task description
It was revealed that the "question marks" picked up in Task 1 were actually "doublers". These could be played before a
task to double the amount of money that could be won in that task. However, one person had to be selected as the keeper
of those doublers. That person would select when to play the doublers, but if that person would be eliminated from the
game, the doublers would also be lost. In return for this "risk", the keeper would be offered an exemption from this
week's elimination.

The participants watched recordings of their own responses when they heard they were selected to be on the Mole. They
could press a button to stop the recording. The three participants who pressed most quickly, were candidates to become
the keeper. These turned out to be Bernard, Karolien, and Stéphanie.

In the next stage, all participants came together. They were told that they had multiple rounds to vote in order to
find and eliminate the candidates. Last candidate standing would become the keeper. For each time they voted for a
non-candidate though (the group did not know who they were), the amount of money to be won in this task was halved. They
started with 4,000 Euros. In the end, the group ended up with 2,000 Euros and Bernard became the keeper and earned the
exemption for episode 1.

#### My conclusion
It makes sense for the Mole to want to be the keeper. They have prior knowledge of the tasks and know which ones are
difficult. They could play the doublers on these tasks. The Mole could also not play the doublers at all or even lose
(some of) them.

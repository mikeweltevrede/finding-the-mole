# Who Is The Mole 2024 - Belgium
It is time for the 2024 season of Who Is The Mole (WIDM) Belgium! In this document, I will outline the results of my
analyses and why I made certain choices.

Note that this document will contain spoilers about the episodes' tasks and who was eliminated.

## Episode 1
### Task 1
#### Task description
In the first task of the first episode, the participants are divided into three groups on or around a ship:
1. Bernard, Charlotte, Senne, Stéphanie: These participants had to connect photos of certain objects to their fellow
    participants, e.g. a Harry Potter book for someone who likes to read Harry Potter.
2. Coco, Gillian, Karolien, Michaël: These participants had to introduce themselves for 58 - 62 seconds. If they failed,
    they had to start over.
3. Lynn, Philippe: These participants had to answer trivia where they had to name 5 answers for a certain category. For
    every correctly answered question, Philippe would be lowered to the ground one meter. If he reached the ground, he
    would be able to fetch Lynn.

PS: Lynn was placed on a boat outside the ship because she (allegedly) was the only person who said they did not want
to be the Mole.

If a group of participants completed their task, they had to press a red button to reveal a map with where to go to get
their notebooks<sup>*</sup>. However, if they pressed that button, the people who did not complete their task yet, would
be eliminated from the rest of the task. If they got the notebook and brought it to the table where the host sat, on
time, they would earn 1,000 Euros per notebook.

In the end, group 1 completed their task first and waited a while for the others to complete their task. In the end,
however, they pressed the button because it took too long. Everyone was able to retrieve a notebook but there was also
something else to collect that was new to this season. They were indicated on the map as question marks (more on their
meaning later). Bernard collected two of these and Senne took the remaining one. The group reached the table in time,
thereby earning 4,000 Euros for the pot.

<sup>*</sup> Candidates of WIDM take notes during the season in a notebook given to them. In Dutch, this is called the
"Molboekje" ("Mole book").

#### My conclusion
I assume that the Mole was able to choose where they wanted to be. It could even be Lynn, for that matter. If I were the
Mole, I would either want to stall my task, thereby taking an almost guaranteed 2,000 or 4,000 Euros away from the
amount to be won, or (more likely) I would want to complete my task and eliminate the others. I think the second option
is more likely and the group you would want to be in is the group where you would have control over the completion.
I think this is only possible in **group 1**, where you could suggest correct answers if you think others might be
completing their tasks soon. Once you are on deck and have access to the button, you can suggest to press it to
eliminate others.

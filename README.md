Wie Is De Mol ("Who is the Mole") is a Dutch television show that has seen consistent popularity. It is also being released in Belgium and there is an American version on Netflix. In this repository, I explore methods to predict who the Mole will be.

I have set the following learning goals for myself so far:
1. I want to get familiar with using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python projects.
1. I want to get familiar with the [polars](https://www.pola.rs/) Python library.
1. I want to get familiar with the [deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry) Python library.
1. I want to get familiar with GitHub Actions to set up a CICD process.
1. I want to get familiar with using Bayesian modelling in Python (inspiration: [CodeErik](https://www.codeerik.nl/widm-2023-op-zoek-naar-de-mol-met-data-analyse/))

If you want to help me along this journey, feel free to reach out! :)
